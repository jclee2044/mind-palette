**Getting Started**  
Welcome to MindPalette, a tool for training, developing, and enhancing your understanding of your synesthetic color associations. This app is yours— an external representation of your internal world, which you can easily share with others. Make it your own and be proud of it!

Navigate through tabs using the menu at the top. Each tab focuses on a different function:

   •  Train: Write new associations.

   •  Summarize: Generate AI-powered summaries of your data.

   •  Chat: Ask questions about your data.

   •  Colors: View and manage individual colors.

   •  Associations: Browse your full dataset.


**Tips & Best Practices**

• Write short but vivid associations for clarity. Be specific.

• Keep entries authentic. Don’t overthink it!

• Remember: More data means better AI responses.

• Save tricky colors for later. They may become easier to describe.

• Periodically revise your descriptions as your perceptions develop.

**Train Tab**  
On this tab, the system will randomly choose a color to display in the box, from the list of colors that do not currently have an association description. All you have to do is write your associations in the text field. Click "Skip/Next Color" or press "Enter" to either skip the current color if you don't want to write an association for it now, or to save your association to the database and move on to the next color.

Click the "Save for Later" button to save a color for later. You can access this list in the Colors tab.

Your associations data is stored both in db/associations.json and backed up in db/associations_backup.json. Note that the more color-association data is in the database, the better the AI responses will become (if you are using the Summarize and Chat features).

Keyboard shortcuts: Press Enter to submit, Shift+Enter to add a newline, Ctrl+A to select all text, and Home/End to move to the start/end of a line.



**Summarize Tab**  
This tab is used to generate summaries of color categories and their associations. You will need an API key to be able to use this function. If you do not have one configured, simply follow the instructions on the Summarize tab to do so.

Click the "Generate Summary" or "New Summary" button at any time to generate a new summary based on the data, organized by color and hue. This may take up to two minutes to generate, after which a popup will appear, and you will be able to see the new summary in the main window. Note that the more color-association data is in the database, the better the AI responses will become.

You can also save the AI-generated summary as a .txt file, or directly copy from the text field. Whenever you generate a new summary, the existing db/summary.txt is replaced, so please export your summaries to .txt if you want to keep multiple versions! Unless you generate a new summary or delete the db/summary.txt file, you will also see the newest summary whenever you open the app. 

The underlying prompt for summary generation is found in gemini_backend.py and can be adjusted there. Please note that our current version does not support full Markdown format and is best limited to about 64 characters per line for readability.



**Chat Tab**  
Here, you can ask your own questions about the data and receive tailored responses. You will need an API key to be able to use this function. If you do not have one configured, simply follow the instructions on the Chat tab to do so.

Simply enter your prompt in the first text box, then click "Generate Response" or press the Enter key to generate the response. It may take up to two minutes to generate. Note that the more color-association data is in the database, the better the AI responses will become.

To save one of the chats, simply click "Save Chat". You can also export it to a .txt file by clicking the "Export to .txt" button or by directly copying any of the text from the response window. To view saved chats, click the "View Saved Chats" button. This will open a popup window with all of your saved chats, which you can select on the left-hand side. To delete a chat, simply press the Delete key on your keyboard.

Keyboard shortcuts: Enter submits your prompt, Shift+Enter creates a newline, Ctrl+A selects all text, Home/End move the cursor to the start or end of a line.

The underlying prompt for summary generation is found in gemini_backend.py and can be adjusted there. Please note that our current version does not support Markdown format and is best limited to about 64 characters per line for readability.



**Colors Tab**  
Here, you can browse and view individual colors. From the "Input Type" dropdown you can select the color name (such as "warm grey" or "indigo blue") or hex code (such as #341c02 or #0485d1). Note that this application uses the XKCD color library, so some hex codes may not have an associated color name.

If you click the "Browse XKCD…" button, you can search for colors, either by scrolling or by applying filters via the search bar at the top. On the table, if a color has already been described, a green ✓ will appear in the Status column. If it has been saved for later, a blue S will appear instead. Clicking on any color will cause that color to appear in the color viewer in the main window.

If you click the "View Saved for Later…" button, you can view the colors that you have saved for later (stored in db/saved_for_later.json), or click the X button to remove any color from the list. As in the XKCD table, clicking on any color will cause that color to appear in the color viewer in the main window.

Once a color has been selected, it will appear in the box, with the color name and hex code underneath. If you have already described any associations for the color, you can view and edit them here. If no association has been described yet, the viewer will say so, and you can click "Write one" to write an association, or click "Save for later" to add the color to the saved list, which is also accessible in this panel. 



**Associations Tab**  
Here you will find a tabular view of your data, organized roughly by rainbow order. You can search any of the fields in the table using the search bar at the top. Click any color square to make it appear in the Colors tab.

You can edit/view any of your associations by clicking the "Edit" button on the right, or delete them by clicking the X button (it will ask you to confirm). The backend file containing the associations (found in db/associations.json) will be automatically updated.

You can also click the "Export Data to Excel" button to export the data to Excel for easy sharing and further analysis. If you are looking to share your data with a researcher, this may be the preferred option.



**API Keys**  
Summarize and Chat require a Gemini API key. Train, Colors, and Associations do not. That means you can start documenting your associations right away!

To add an API key:
• Go to the Summarize or Chat tab.
• Click "Add one…" when prompted.
• Follow the popup instructions to create and paste your key.
• Keys are saved in the .env file and loaded automatically.

To update your key, you can directly edit the .env file with your new key or delete the file and repeat the above process. The old key will be overwritten.


**Data Storage and Privacy**  
Your data is always stored locally in the db/ folder and will be saved regardless of when you close or open the app.. We do not collect any of your data!

• Associations: db/associations.json, db/associations_backup.json
• Saved for Later: db/saved_for_later.json
• Summary: db/summary.txt
• Saved Chats: db/saved_chats.json
• API Key: .env

Feel free to share your exports with researchers or collaborators!


**FAQs**  
Q: Where do the colors come from and how many are there in total?
A: The app uses the XKCD color library from Matplotlib (see https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/), which contains about 950 colors, as named by several hundred thousand participants. Once you’ve written associations for all of them, the Train tab will tell you you’ve finished.

Q: Why do some colors look almost identical?
A: The XKCD list includes many subtle shades with only minor differences in hex code. This is intentional, to capture nuance in human perception.

Q: Why does the same color look different on my monitor compared to another device?
A: Colors may appear slightly different depending on your screen’s brightness, calibration, and settings. The hex code itself is always consistent.

Q: What if I save a color for later, but then describe it in Train?
A: The “saved for later” entry is automatically removed once you write and save an association for that color.

Q: What happens if I delete an association?
A: If you delete a color’s association in the Associations tab, that color goes back into the pool of “untrained” colors. The next time you use the Train tab, it may appear again.

Q: Can I write multiple associations for the same color?
A: Currently, each color can only store one text block at a time, but you can store multiple associations together. You may find it helpful to separate them by senses ("Smell: x, Sound: y").

Q: Can I undo changes after editing an association?
A: There’s no undo button, but you can edit the entry again. If you want to preserve earlier versions, export your associations before making changes.

Q: What happens if the database file gets corrupted?
A: The app maintains an automatic backup in db/associations_backup.json. If db/associations.json can’t be loaded, the app will try to load from the backup instead.

Q: Can I use this app offline?
A: Yes. Training, Colors, and Associations tabs work fully offline. Summarize and Chat require an internet connection and a valid API key.

Q: Is my API key stored securely?
A: The key is saved in a local .env file. It is not uploaded anywhere. If you share your project folder, remove .env first if you don’t want others to see your key.

Q: Can I share my associations with someone else who has the app?
A: Yes. Just send them your db/associations.json (or an exported Excel/text file). They can place it into their own db/ folder to load your associations.

Q: Why does Chat sometimes give a very general answer instead of using my data?
A: The AI is trained to blend your associations with general knowledge. If your database is small, it may lean more on general associations until more data is added.

Q: Can I change how the summaries or chat responses are written?
A: Yes. The prompts used for both are located in gemini_backend.py. If you are comfortable editing Python code, you can adjust the wording, formatting, or style instructions.
